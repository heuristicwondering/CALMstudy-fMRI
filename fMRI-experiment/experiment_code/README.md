# Experiment Code

**This experiement is organized as follows:**

## Folders
- **./generic** - *Contains code that is common across all experiments.*
- **./infant** - *Code that is specific to the infant viewing task*
- **./rest** - *Code for both the rest and rest-alternate scans*


## Files
There are 2 basic files for each subpackage.

- **setup.py** - takes care of everything that should be done *before* anything is presented to the participant.
- **experiment.py** - takes care of things that need to happen during stimuli presentation.
