Note that this is where you would place all video you would like to play during scan.

The start of videos are time locked to the start of volume acquisition. The current time length for each video is set for 12 seconds.

This means if your video is longer than 12 seconds, it will be truncated at 12s.
If your video is shorter than 12 seconds, it will be truncated at the largest multiple of the repitition time. (Currently set at TR = 1s)
